OpCodes:
	99 = End program

	1  = Add
		array[1, x, y, z]
		array[z] = array[x] + array[y]

	2  = Multiply
		array[1, x, y, z]
		array[z] = array[x] * array[y]

	3  = Input single integer
		Take a single integer input, saves it to the position in the parameter
			array[3, 50]
			input => array[50] = input

	4 = Output parameter value
		array[4, 50]
		Outputs array[50]       

Parameter modes:

	0 = Position mode
		"which causes the parameter to be interpreted as a position -
		if the parameter is 50, its value is the value stored at address 50 in memory."

	1 = Immediate mode
		"In immediate mode, a parameter is interpreted as a value - 
		if the parameter is 50, its value is simply 50."

Makeup of an instruction:
	ABCDE
	 1002

	DE - two-digit opcode,      02 == opcode 2
	 C - mode of 1st parameter,  0 == position mode
	 B - mode of 2nd parameter,  1 == immediate mode
	 A - mode of 3rd parameter,  0 == position mode,
									  omitted due to being a leading zero
        
Further notes:
	Address of current instruction is called the instruction pointer. (starts at 0)
	Instructions can have different sizes of instructions, (some need 3 array some take 5 etc)

	Parameters that an instruction writes to will never be in immediate mode.
